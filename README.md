### Energy Generation Analysis Project

**Project Overview:**

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my internship task focused on analyzing energy generation data using the numpy library in Python. The project involves exploring the contribution of different energy sources to the total energy generation in the USA and determining whether the national grid is shifting toward wind energy.

**Objective:** Analyze energy generation data to understand the contribution of wind and solar energy sources and assess the shift toward wind energy.
