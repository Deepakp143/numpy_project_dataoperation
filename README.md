Energy Generation Analysis Project

Project Overview:

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for my internship task focused on analyzing energy generation data using the numpy library in Python.
The project involves exploring the contribution of different energy sources to the total energy generation in the USA and determining whether the national grid is shifting toward wind energy.

Objective: Analyze energy generation data to understand the contribution of wind and solar energy sources and assess the shift toward wind energy.
Tools Used: Python, numpy library for data analysis.
Data Source: The project uses a structured dataset resembling a CSV format, containing information about energy sources, years, and energy values.
Key Tasks: Calculating energy contributions, comparing sources, and making conclusions based on analysis.
Results: Determining the contribution percentages of wind, solar, and combined energy sources, and assessing the national grid's shift toward wind energy.
Project Structure:



This project is part of my internship tasks, and the analysis provided is based on the data provided.
The conclusions drawn are specific to this dataset and may not reflect real-world energy trends comprehensively.
